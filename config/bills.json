    "fullDescription": "Plutus is a governance aggregator, built to optimize user liquidity and rewards while consolidating protocol governance through the PLUTUS token. Instead of traditional veTokens, users interact with plsASSETs to stay liquid, earn rewards, and actively participate in governance. The platform has partnered with key Arbitrum protocols like Camelot, Stryke, Radiant, GMX, Sperax, and Jones to deliver governance-enhanced products. Plutus offers two core product types: plsASSETs, which streamline governance and liquidity efficiency, and plvASSETs, vaults aimed at maximizing rewards and composability. The PLUTUS token ($PLUTUS), a LayerZero OFT live on Arbitrum and Berachain, underpins the ecosystem, while $xPLUTUS, its escrowed yield-bearing variant, serves as the DAO’s primary voting and value-accrual mechanism. For full benefits, holders must lock PLUTUS as bPLS for 16 weeks."

    "fullDescription": "GraphLinq is a blockchain ecosystem designed for seamless on-chain automation and dApp development, harnessing the power of AI. With a no-code, user-friendly online interface, GraphLinq empowers users to generate and manage blockchain data without any coding expertise. This platform enables users to easily create cryptocurrencies, monitor smart contract activities, set up bots for tasks like handling subscriptions, track automated market maker (AMM) pair activities, and execute trades on centralized exchanges based on decentralized data. Users can also perform automated DEX arbitrage through customizable graphs on the GraphLinq engine. By building with nodes—interconnected blocks that transmit data to other nodes—GraphLinq allows users to create structured execution paths that operate on either the blockchain or GraphLinq’s engine. Once configured, users can deploy their workflows on the testnet or mainnet, seamlessly transitioning from testing to production. GLQ is the native asset of GraphLinq Chain, used for all financial transactions within the protocol and for community needs. The GLQ token powers the execution of graphs on the GraphLinq engine network, covering fees required for operations. Tokens minted since inception and used as gas fees for graph execution are burned, gradually reducing supply to promote a balanced evolution curve and support market adoption."

These initiatives, either already live or in development, are all intrinsically linked to the SDEX token, which serves as the cornerstone of the ecosystem’s value and utility. What sets SmarDex apart is its fair and transparent token distribution—no tokens were reserved for founders or private investors; all participants acquired their SDEX tokens directly from the public market, eliminating future unlock-related sell pressure. To further reinforce SDEX’s value, SmarDex integrates a robust buyback and burn mechanism via the USDN protocol: 8% of every funding rate from vault or long positions is used to buy and burn SDEX, and 5% of each USDN mint is converted to SDEX and burned. This model steadily reduces SDEX’s circulating supply as USDN adoption grows, creating sustained upward pressure on its price."

With 25% of its supply permanently burnt and 690,420 $LINUS distributed to top meme and art creators, it quickly became a cultural pillar in the ecosystem. Linus gained momentum after Pengmilio infiltrated Linea HQ, earning direct support from Linea itself. It reached the top spot on Lynex Farms by APR and formed strong partnerships with Linea-native dApps and prominent builders. As a top organic community, $LINUS holders are actively rewarded with airdrops from projects like Wizards of Linea and Magi, with more to come. As Linea’s ecosystem expands—now surpassing $1.2B in TVL—$LINUS offers an easy and humorous way to gain exposure. Rather than farming LXP-L points with whales chasing a $1B+ airdrop, users can simply hold the LINUS token, a playful yet powerful proxy for Linea’s explosive growth."

This innovative design enables users to trade cryptocurrencies with better deals and minimal slippage. The use of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), particularly constant function market makers (CFMMs), has grown dramatically in recent years, with many new automated market maker (AMM) models emerging annually. Despite their widespread adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), slippage remains a major hurdle. To stay aligned with the DeFi ethos while maximizing DEX trade performance, new forms of innovation are necessary. Xfai's weighted model significantly improves trade performance compared to other DEX designs, heralding a new era of seamless and efficient trading in decentralized finance."

    "fullDescription": "ICHI is a versatile DeFi protocol that provides innovative solutions for liquidity management and stablecoin creation. Utilizing factory contracts, ICHI has developed two key protocols: Yield IQ Vaults, which offer auto-liquidity management, and Branded Dollars, enabling the creation of stablecoins tailored for any community. Users can interact with these protocols through the ICHI App, accessible at the ICHI website, where they can deposit into Vaults. The governance of ICHI is managed through its ICHI token, empowering token holders to oversee the ecosystem, operate protocols, and ensure accountability among contributors. Furthermore, ICHI fosters engagement within the web3 community through developer bounties, ambassador programs, student initiatives, and community events, providing ample opportunities for participation and growth. Yield IQ is a concentrated liquidity provision algorithm that generates compelling returns with a simple and painless user experience. Users deposit a single token and earn passive returns while the algorithm actively accumulates their preferred token and earns fees. Yield IQ on ICHI's Vaults provides an automated liquidity management strategy, allowing liquidity providers to accumulate more of their deposited assets without requiring project farming rewards. Users deposit their preferred token and receive LP tokens representing their share in the liquidity pool. Yield IQ then deploys these tokens into concentrated liquidity AMMs like Uniswap V3, adjusting positions based on market conditions. This allows users to earn trading fees and benefit from potential appreciation. Users can withdraw their initial deposit and earnings at any time by exchanging their LP tokens for their share of assets in the vault."

With the earned tokens, users can sell them on a secondary market or create games with the help of AI. As the world's first platform to offer this concept, WAM requires only a few minutes of time and a competitive spirit to participate in global tournaments accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

    "fullDescription": "MeMusic is reshaping the value flow in the music and audio industry by addressing key issues such as limited revenue-generating opportunities, generational devaluation of music, and the complexities of the music supply chain. It provides audio content creators, including musicians, remixers, and podcasters, with a networking solution for an interactive fan-creator economy, featuring low barriers to entry and tokenized incentives to attract both creators and listeners. Future phases of MeMusic aim to introduce token-gated content and social networking, offering creator and label tokens for exclusive experiences and NFT-based revenue sharing by fractionalizing royalty rights. Additionally, MeMusic plans to enhance music streaming with blockchain technology, focusing on artist-centered royalty distribution. Initially, MeMusic started as an initiative to create a robust streaming application powered by blockchain technology. During the project's research phase, the market saw the emergence of platforms like Audius, which aimed to revolutionize music distribution. However, decentralized streaming platforms faced significant challenges with licensing mainstream music and compensating artists due to the lack of user payment systems. MeMusic aimed to resolve these issues. After participating in the Filecoin Basecamp program, MeMusic's business vertical expanded, pivoting from merely building a better streaming application to fostering a comprehensive, artist-supportive ecosystem. This shift highlighted the need for a brand that better resonates with their enhanced mission."

These strategies are designed to perform differently from existing ALM solutions (such as Gamma and Steer) by trailing asset price dynamically to market conditions, that reduces unnecessary rebalancing hence the Impermanent Loss. The strategies listed on A51 Yield Supercharger are optimized to offer the best possible yield while minimizing impermanent loss. This is achieved through our unique mode-switching capability, which trails the price movements and adjusts accordingly.",

The Yield Supercharger specifically aims to maximize your yield potential while minimizing risks. The A51 team has meticulously curated a range of strategies using their ALM 2.0 mechanism. These strategies are designed to perform differently from existing ALM solutions (such as Gamma and Steer) by trailing asset price dynamically to market conditions, that reduces unnecessary rebalancing hence the Impermanent Loss. The strategies listed on A51 Yield Supercharger are optimized to offer the best possible yield while minimizing impermanent loss. This is achieved through our unique mode-switching capability, which trails the price movements and adjusts accordingly.",

The Yield Supercharger specifically aims to maximize your yield potential while minimizing risks. The A51 team has meticulously curated a range of strategies using their ALM 2.0 mechanism. These strategies are designed to perform differently from existing ALM solutions (such as Gamma and Steer) by trailing asset price dynamically to market conditions, that reduces unnecessary rebalancing hence the Impermanent Loss. The strategies listed on A51 Yield Supercharger are optimized to offer the best possible yield while minimizing impermanent loss. This is achieved through our unique mode-switching capability, which trails the price movements and adjusts accordingly.",

    "fullDescription": "Kima is a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain that solves cross-chain interoperability without adding liquidity fragmentation by enabling atomic swaps across multiple blockchains—like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana—without wrapping tokens. It uses a unique committee-based consensus with rotating “wardens” who manage liquidity pools and authorize transfers only after validating source-chain deposits, leveraging Threshold Signature Schemes inside Trusted Execution Environments for added security. Kima operates on a dual-layer model: a permissioned validator layer with trusted entities and a permissionless layer for broader participation. The protocol governs warden selection, platform parameters, and records every swap for full auditability, while also enabling future cross-chain messaging. Kima’s token, $KIMA, underpins security, validator rewards, ecosystem growth, and transaction and liquidity operations, ensuring a decentralized and efficient cross-chain experience."

Codifight mission is to combine AI, creative freedom, and community innovation through custom games, metagame control, AI battles, and open-source coding sharing. Codyfight is a gaming platform for AI and human players, offering chess-like depth and ever-evolving battles against AI-controlled NPCs. Players can choose to lead Codyfighters in every battle or evoke programming excitement with trained AI bots. The entities controlled in the game, known as Codyfighters, are battle-ready robots that players can own multiple of, each with unique names and individual rankings. Rewards are earned through competitive fighting, challenges, and mini-games. Codyfight allows both humans and AI entities to rule the battlefield, with players able to develop AI bots using any programming language to control their robots. This inclusive and immersive experience is free, with no entrance fees upon registration. A default Codyfighter and a CKey are provided for free, while additional CKeys can be obtained via subscription. Codyfighters can be acquired through purchases in Codyfight's official shop, from other players in the marketplace, or through in-game achievements. Players can avoid continuous gameplay grinding by deploying smart AI bots that play autonomously, allowing developers to sell or rent these robots. The game also focuses on community, enabling active members to profit from organizing tournaments, championships, and hosting custom creative games and leagues."

We are an open ecosystem where any developer can contribute to the Smart Contract, Blockchain, Subnets, and dApp Template Library. Developers will profit from the transaction fees or fixed fees (as they desire) charged on the applications they develop and add to the marketplace. This functionality is similar to the “WordPress plugin directory” with its independent revenue models.

The protocol’s native token, ALVA, is an ERC-20 utility token serving multiple functions within the platform, including access to governance, rewards, and software portals. ALVA is included in each BTS minted at a nominal 5% weighting, creating deflationary pressure on its supply as each additional BTS removes a percentage of ALVA from circulation. The included ALVA is market-bought, increasing buying pressure with every new BTS creation. Alvara empowers individuals and institutions to create, manage, and invest in fully decentralized, merit-based, on-chain baskets. Committed to transforming conventional procedures and pioneering a new DeFi subsector, Alvara aims to establish ERC-7621 as the gold standard for on-chain basket creation while adhering to decentralization principles.

    "fullDescription": "GraphLinq is a blockchain ecosystem designed for seamless on-chain automation and dApp development, harnessing the power of AI. With a no-code, user-friendly online interface, GraphLinq empowers users to generate and manage blockchain data without any coding expertise. This platform enables users to easily create cryptocurrencies, monitor smart contract activities, set up bots for tasks like handling subscriptions, track automated market maker (AMM) pair activities, and execute trades on centralized exchanges based on decentralized data. Users can also perform automated DEX arbitrage through customizable graphs on the GraphLinq engine. By building with nodes—interconnected blocks that transmit data to other nodes—GraphLinq allows users to create structured execution paths that operate on either the blockchain or GraphLinq’s engine. Once configured, users can deploy their workflows on the testnet or mainnet, seamlessly transitioning from testing to production. GLQ is the native asset of GraphLinq Chain, used for all financial transactions within the protocol and for community needs. The GLQ token powers the execution of graphs on the GraphLinq engine network, covering fees required for operations. Tokens minted since inception and used as gas fees for graph execution are burned, gradually reducing supply to promote a balanced evolution curve and support market adoption."
