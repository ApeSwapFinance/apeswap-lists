## How to Manage this Repo

When you would like to make an edit to one of the lists in this repo, please only edit the `.ts` files. This is for better type control and to reduce the chance of errors. To apply the chnages run `yarn` in the console.

For example, to edit a farm:

1. Open the `constants/farms.ts` file
2. Make the edits & save
3. Run `yarn` or `yarn start` to apply these changes to the corresponding JSON files
4. Commit to the Github repo

Humans interact with the TypeScript files & our services pull in the JSON files! ❤️
